				My name is <b style="color:#f2511b">Deepak Terse</b>.
			</h3>
			<p>
				I'm a software developer based in Mumbai (🇮🇳) who is passionate about problem-solving. My primary expertise and focus lies in <span style="color:#f2511b">full-stack web development</span> and <span style="color:#f2511b">DevOps</span>. However, I'm also familiar with mobile app development, automation scripts, BI and analytic tools enabling me to approach projects holistically.	
			</p>
			<p>
				Looking ahead to 2024, I'm excited to contribute to open-source projects, particularly in JavaScript utility libraries, where I aim to make a positive impact and expand my skill set further.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of coding, I stay active through sports and find peace in nature. My other hobbies include travelling and reading.
